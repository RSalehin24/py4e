#### naming convention
```
in python snake_case is used as naming convention
```
#### round()
```
round(97.8)

will input 97. Will return the int part of the given number
```
#### comment
```
'#' is used to comment in python
```
#### print(x,y)
```
',' in print will show a space in console. print('x', 'y') will print 'x y' in console
```
#### input()
```
input always returns a string. So use int(), float() to convert to number or use other functions to convert to other types
```
#### Indent and Colon (:)
```
python uses indent to recognize a block of code, so indentation in python matters. Python also user colon (:) to if, def etc like below:

if x == 3 :
  print("This statement will be printed")
print("This statement will not be printed as it is not intended to include inside the block") 
```
#### elif
```
if x == 3 :
  print("this is if")
elif x == 4 :
  print("this is elif")
else :
  print("this is else")
```
#### traceback
```
str = "Bob0230"

try:
  str_int = int(str)
except:
  str_int = -1
```
